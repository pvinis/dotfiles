# --- Injection Backend
# Espanso supports multiple ways of injecting text into applications. Each of
# them has its quirks, therefore you may want to change it if you are having problems.
# By default, espanso uses the "Auto" backend which should work well in most cases,
# but you may want to try the "Clipboard" or "Inject" backend in case of issues.
# backend: Clipboard
